## üéÆ Available Commands

- **Sustainability**: "sustainable crypto", "eco-friendly", "green coins"
- **Profitability**: "trending up", "profitable", "rising cryptos"
- **Specific Info**: "tell me about Bitcoin", "Ethereum info"

## üß† AI Decision-Making Logic

The chatbot mimics AI decision-making through:

### 1. Intent Recognition
```python
def analyze_query(self, user_input):
    query = user_input.lower()
    if any(word in query for word in ['sustainable', 'eco', 'green']):
        return 'sustainability'
    elif any(word in query for word in ['profit', 'rising', 'trending']):
        return 'profitability'
    # ... more conditions
```

### 2. Data-Driven Recommendations
```python
def get_sustainable_crypto(self):
    best_crypto = max(self.crypto_db.items(), 
                     key=lambda x: x[1]['sustainability_score'])
    return recommendation
```

### 3. Multi-Criteria Decision Making
```python
def get_general_advice(self):
    # Find cryptos that balance sustainability AND profitability
    for name, data in self.crypto_db.items():
        if data['sustainability_score'] >= 6 and data['price_trend'] == 'rising':
            balanced_cryptos.append((name, data))
```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
